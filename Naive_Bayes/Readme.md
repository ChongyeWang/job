# Resume Classification Model, which is Naive Bayes

## Overview  
A machine learning pipeline for classifying the resumes and based on text. I worked on  **Naïve Bayes** Model  for classifying the resumes.
I will implement BERT Transformer in the Spring break for Job recommendation. 
 ## Dataset Used
  Format: This dataset has resumes in PDF format and their corresponding text representations.
  Before Cleaning the data in data cleaning step, The datset had 171 columns and after cleaning it had only 5 columns. and before, it had 3445 rows and after removing noisy data,
  it has 2458 rows only.
  And this dataset is segregated the fields of jobs like medicine, agriculture, HR and Information Technology and all. It totally has 24 classes of fields. 
## Features  
The features which i have contributed are 
- **Resume Classification:** Identifies flagged/unflagged resumes.  
- **Data Cleaning:** Cleaned the unwanted rows and columns and made the Dataset clear and optimal. For a model to work optimally, A dataset is very important.
- If the Datset is good, then the model can give better results.
 
- **Data Processing:** SMOTE, and undersampling.  
- **ML Models:** Naïve Bayes for classification of resumes.
